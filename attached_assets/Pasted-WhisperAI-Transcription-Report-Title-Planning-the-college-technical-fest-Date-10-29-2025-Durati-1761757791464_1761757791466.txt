Good morning everyone.
Let's get started with our Technova 2025 planning meeting. We have around three weeks before we
need to send our proposal to the principal.
So let's finalize major points today.
Good morning Sakshi. I have shortlisted a few technical events. We can organize a 24 hour
hackathon, a web design challenge and a robotics line follower event. We can also conduct a small
workshop on AI and cloud computing.
That sounds good. Nayana, do we have the required mentor or faculty coordinators for the events?
Yes, I have spoken to Professor Mehat and Professor Rekha. They both are agreed to guide us
during the hackathon and workshop.
That's great. But before finalizing I would like to know the approximate budget required. We only
have 25,000 from the student association so far. We will need sponsor for any additional amount.
The hackathon would cost around 10,000 mainly for prizes and refreshments. The workshop will
need another 5,000 for materials and certificates. Alright Priya, can we manage that with the
sponsors you contacted? Yes, I reached out two local IT companies.
One from Mysore and another from Bangalore. They are interested in sponsoring. If you give them
branding space and a short slot I will send them the event proposal by tomorrow. Perfect timing,
Pratiksha.
Once we finalize the sponsors, I'll start with poster designs and Instagram promotions. I am
planning a countdown to Technova campaign. One post per day starting next week. That's great,
Nikita.
Make sure the posters have a consistent. Consistent theme. May be innovation for tomorrow as the
tagline. Yes, I like that.
I'll ask the design club to help with the graphics and videos.
Also we'll need a banner for the college gate and few standees for the auditorium. Just a note.
Let's keep physical printing within 2000.
We can focus more on digital marketing. Agreed.
Also Nikita, I will share the event schedule once it's ready.
So you can include QR codes for registration in the posters.
Excellent coordination.
Now logistics. Nikita, can you check the availability of the main seminar hall and labs? Yes, I
already did.
The seminar hall is free on 20th and 21st March.
So labs can be booked through the HOD.
So I'll submit the form today. Perfect.
So let's log March 2021 for Technova 2025.
Everyone okay with that? Yes. I will also start preparing the budget sheet with event wise expenses
and expected income from us.
Forms list. And I will finalize the event rules and judges list by this weekend. I'll make sure
registration forms go live by Monday.
Awesome teamwork everyone.
Before we wrap up our next meeting, we'll be on Friday 4pm in the seminar room to review
progress. Please have updates ready. Anything else before we close? No, that's all from my side.
Same here. All good.
Let's make Technova a big success. Yes.
Okay.
Absolutely. Thanks everyone. Meeting Arjun. Thank you.
